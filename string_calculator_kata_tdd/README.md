# string_calculator_kata_tdd

Flutter Project to 
Implement the String Calculator Kata using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology

## String Calculator Kata - Strict TDD Implementation

I'll demonstrate the String Calculator Kata following strict TDD: Red-Green-Refactor cycle. We start with a failing test, write minimal code to make it pass (green), then refactor. All in Dart for Flutter relevance.
