# string_calculator_kata_tdd

Flutter Project to 
Implement the String Calculator Kata using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology

## String Calculator Kata - Strict TDD Implementation

I'll demonstrate the String Calculator Kata following strict TDD: Red-Green-Refactor cycle. We start with a failing test, write minimal code to make it pass (green), then refactor. All in Dart for Flutter relevance.

Project follows a "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle for each requirement. 

| **RED** | Write a failing test first |
| **GREEN** | Write minimal code to make the test pass |
| **REFACTOR** | Refactor the code while keeping tests green |
